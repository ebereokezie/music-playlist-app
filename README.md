## Usage

This application was created for users to create their own individualized playlists that will contain their favorite songs. Users can add their own specialized playlists, along with a specific image that represents this playlist. Playlists can be edited or deleted, as required by users. A song library is provided for users, and from this library, users can add songs to their specific playlists. Inside the playlists, songs can be reviewed, and if a song is entered in error, this song can be deleted from the playlist as required.

Rails backend template was forked and cloned from Flatiron repository, and ```bundle install``` was used to retrieve Ruby gems. ```React``` frontend was created running ```npm create-react-app```.
